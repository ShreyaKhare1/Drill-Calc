  <p>Oil and gas reserves are located in the subsurface, several thousand feet below ground. Their exploration and production requires construction of well bore from earth surface to the subsurface reservoir. Drilling of such deep well bores requires suitable machines and good understanding of characteristics of subsurface reservoirs. Oil & Gas Rigs are massive and complex machine used for drilling of wellbores into the oil and gas reservoir. Rigs implement complex mechanical, electrical & electronics, hydraulic, chemical and geological technology for successful construction of well bore. Planning, design and construction of oil and gas wells is a complex engineering project. Drilling engineers perform several calculations to estimate the requirement of drilling tools, fluids, consumables and other accessories for construction of wellbore. They do day-to-day hydraulics, well control, mud and drilling engineering calculations at the well construction site. They also calculate the gross time required for well construction and estimate non-productive time & invisible lost time spent during drilling and completion of well. </p>
  <p>Keeping this in mind, DrillCalc is an ideal ready reckoner for a drilling engineer. This handbook explains in a lucid manner, with suitable drawings, the concept behind various drilling engineering calculations. This book is useful to drilling engineer at the planning, drilling and completion phase of the well. Students of Petroleum engineering can learn and practice various calculations, which are part of their curriculum. There are modules on Basic calculation, drilling engineering, drilling hydraulics, well control and drilling fluids, which are useful to both students and professionals in the field.</p>

<h2>Value added Services: Drilling Optimization</h2>
<h3>These services require a batch of real time data in a specific format. Data input produces graphic trend with depth or time. </h3>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE)</h3>: MSE is a valuable optimization tool for drilling professionals. It is the amount of energy required to drill unit rock volume. MSE trend identify drilling inefficiencies. Objective of drilling optimization is to reduce MSE and increase ROP. Drillers maintain least MSE and high ROP by varying WOB, RPM and mud flow rate. Unexpected MSE changes indicate formation change or poor drilling parameters. MSE should be close to formation true compressive strength. </li>
